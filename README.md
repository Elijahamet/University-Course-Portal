👩‍🎓 Personas & Design Considerations

This project was designed with students and lecturers in mind:

Students → want a simple, stress-free way to submit and track assignments.

Lecturers → want clear visibility into student submissions.

Applied HCI principles:

Consistency: Same layout across modules.

Visibility: Deadlines and grades are highlighted.

Feedback: Success/error messages guide users.

Accessibility: Readable typography, color contrast, keyboard navigation.

🧪 Reflection & Future Work

If given more time, user testing would explore:

How quickly students can submit an assignment without confusion.

Whether deadlines are clearly visible to reduce late submissions.

How well the messaging system supports real communication.

Planned improvements:

Authentication with student/lecturer roles.

Database integration (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).

Real-time notifications with WebSockets.
